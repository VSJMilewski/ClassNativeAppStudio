Week: 2

App: Four in a Row

This weeks assignment was to work with layouts and create a nice looking app where the views are located on nice locations on the screen.
I used four in a row for this. You need a nice grid where multiple image views are placed. A row of buttons is needed and ofcourse some textviews to report messages.

In this app the possibility to extend is created, like playing against a pc. For now it is only a two player game.
