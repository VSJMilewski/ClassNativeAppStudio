App: Four in a Row

This weeks assignment was to work with layouts and create a nice looking app where the views are located on nice locations on the screen. The app should also have a nice layout when switching to landscape mode. 
I used four in a row for this. You need a nice grid where multiple image views are placed. A row of buttons is needed and ofcourse some textviews to report messages. You can choose to play against a second player or against a bot. After selection you move into the second screen where the game is played.
