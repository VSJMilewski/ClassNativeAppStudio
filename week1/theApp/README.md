This is the app that I made for the first week. It is a number guessing game. You have to enter a number. 
The game tells you if it had to be higher, lower or if it was correct. 
It counts how many guesses you made. 
If you do multiple numbers in one game, it also remembers your best score. When you close the app, the best score is reset. 

of course there is a fun button that changes the background color ;)
